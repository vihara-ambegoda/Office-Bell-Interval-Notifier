# Office Bell : Interval Notifier

Automated Office Bell System using ESP and RTC

** This project simulates and runs an automated office bell system using an ESP microcontroller and a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module.

# Automated Office Bell System (Wokwi Simulation)

This project simulates an embedded office bell system using an ESP microcontroller and an RTC module, created in the Wokwi simulation environment.

## 🔧 Project Scope

- **Simulation Environment**: [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com)
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 / ESP8266
- **RTC Module**: DS3231
- **Purpose**: Automate office bell ringing at scheduled times

## 📌 My Contribution

- Designed and tested the full simulation using Wokwi
- Wrote the embedded C/C++ code for ESP to communicate with RTC and trigger the bell
- Verified logic and timing using simulated buzzer
- Provided the codebase and documentation for hardware implementation

> **Note:** Actual hardware deployment (wiring, soldering, mounting) was completed by another team member.
